## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is a follow-up challenge of the previous [Penguin Fashion Landing Page](https://penguin-fashion.vercel.app/). But for this challenge I use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). In this project, I learn how to use column order for multiple device view as well how to optimize text align for mobile-first workflow.

### Continued Development

Though I love to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), but [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) has some pre-built component such as navbar, carousel etc. For this reason, it is easier to rapid coding a site with **Bootstrap**.
